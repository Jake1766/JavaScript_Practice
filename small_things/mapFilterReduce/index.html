    <h1>Map, Filter and Reduce</h1>
    <p>Javascript provides a number of built in methods. Map, filter and reduce are three incredibly useful ones. I'm having a little trouble getting to grips with 
        .reduce(), so I'm going to lay out all three here and play around with them until they make sense.

    <div class="container" id="mapContainer">
        <p>The map function is called on an array and passed a function to execute on every item of the array.<p>
