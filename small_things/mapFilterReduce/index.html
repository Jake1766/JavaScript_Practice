    <h1>Map, Filter, and Reduce</h1>
    <p>Javascript provides a number of built in methods. Map, filter and reduce are three incredibly useful ones. I'm having a little trouble getting to grips with 
        .reduce(), so I'm going to lay out all three here and play around with them until they make sense.
    </p>

    <div class="container" id="mapContainer">
        <p>The map function is called on an array and passed a function to execute on every item of the array.<p>
            <div id="mapImg">
                <img src="images/mappedimage.png">
            </div>
        <p>Here we can see that the .map is called on an existing array, then performing the function 
            addone() on each item, adding the result to a new array and returning the new array. 
            The result is that a new array is created, mappedArr = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Ez.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container" id="filterContainer">
        <p>The next method to examine is .filter(). This method is similarly called on an existing array, 
            however it's argument should be a conditional in the form of an arrow function. This function will
            return a value when the condition is met, adding it to a new array. Upon finishing looping the 
            array a new array is returned from the .filter() function that is composed of all elements that 
            pass the conditional.
