    <h1>Map, Filter and Reduce</h1>
    <p>Javascript provides a number of built in methods. Map, filter and reduce are three incredibly useful ones. I'm having a little trouble getting to grips with 
        .reduce(), so I'm going to lay out all three here and play around with them until they make sense.
